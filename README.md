# Getting Started with React App

## Purpose
This is my first React applications, I learn new concepts through applying them. You know the good ol' developer's quote: 

"Use it, or lose it."

## Applications
Componets that create a unified usecase, should be split into individual repositories.
#### Matrix Red Pill Blue Pill
#### Dominatrix ToDo App (coming soon)

## Components
Components that aren't unified so far.
#### Dark Mode Toggle
#### Sign Up Form
#### Timer
